# Telegram Voucher Bot

## What 💁🏼‍♂️
This is the code for a Telegram Bot that allows registering shops.
Well, it actually doesn't allow that yet!

In order to make it do something, change the `voucherLocationRepoDummy` in `VoucherLocation/Repository` to a real one.

## Build 🛠
```
npm install
npx spago build
```

## Run 🏃🏽‍♀️
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN={API TOKEN} npx spago run
```
